# Dynamic Multi-Source Query Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Core Query Plan System (`plan.rs`)

#### Data Structures
- ✅ **`RelationshipAccessor`**: Type-erased relationship traversal
  - Handles both `Relationship` (single entity) and `RelationshipTarget` (collection) components
  - Uses field offsets for direct entity access
  - Uses iterator functions for collection access

- ✅ **`QueryTerm`**: Individual entity source in a multi-source query
  - Contains `FilteredAccess` for component requirements and filters
  - `matches()` method checks if an entity satisfies the term's requirements
  - Supports With/Without filters via FilteredAccess

- ✅ **`QueryRelationship`**: Connection between two terms
  - Source and target term indices
  - Relationship component ID
  - Accessor for traversing the relationship

- ✅ **`QueryPlan`**: Complete query execution graph
  - Vector of terms
  - Vector of relationships
  - Main term index (the one we iterate over)
  - `execute()` method using recursive backtracking to find all matches
  - `combined_access()` for getting total access requirements

#### Builder APIs
- ✅ **`QueryPlanBuilder`**: Low-level API
  - `add_term(FilteredAccess)` -> term index
  - `add_relationship(source, target, component, accessor)`
  - `build(main_term_index)` -> QueryPlan

- ✅ **`TypedQueryPlanBuilder`**: High-level typed API
  - `with::<Component>()` -> term with read access
  - `with_mut::<Component>()` -> term with write access
  - `term()` -> empty term
  - `add_read::<Component>(term)` -> add component to existing term
  - `add_write::<Component>(term)` -> add mutable component access
  - `without::<Component>(term)` -> add Without filter
  - `related_to::<Relationship>(source, target)` -> connect terms
  - `build(main_term)` -> QueryPlan

### 2. Dynamic WorldQuery (`dynamic.rs`)

#### WorldQuery Implementation
- ✅ **`Dynamic`**: Main WorldQuery type
  - Implements `WorldQuery` trait
  - Implements `QueryData` trait
  - Implements `ReadOnlyQueryData` trait
  - Implements `IterQueryData` trait

- ✅ **`DynamicState`**: Query state
  - Contains the `QueryPlan`
  - `from_plan()` constructor
  - Accessors for the plan

- ✅ **`DynamicFetch`**: Fetch state for iteration
  - Stores world reference
  - Tracks current entity being processed

- ✅ **`DynamicItem`**: Result for one main entity
  - Contains all matching entity combinations
  - `iter()` to iterate over matches
  - `len()` and `is_empty()` helpers

- ✅ **`DynamicMatch`**: Single matched combination
  - Vector of entities (one per term)
  - `entity(term_index)` -> get entity ID
  - `entity_ref(term_index)` -> get FilteredEntityRef
  - `get::<Component>(term_index)` -> get component from matched entity
  - `entities()` -> get all entities as slice

## How It Works

### Query Plan Execution

When you call `plan.execute(main_entity, world)`:

1. **Initialize**: Start with the main entity
2. **Check Main Term**: Verify main entity matches its term's requirements
3. **Recursive Resolution**:
   - For each relationship from current term:
     - Get related entities via `RelationshipAccessor`
     - Check if each related entity matches its term
     - Recursively resolve from that entity
     - Backtrack to try other possibilities
4. **Collect Results**: Return all complete matches

### Example Execution Flow

For query: `Child(Health) -> Parent(Health)` via `ChildOf`

```
execute(child_entity, world):
  ✓ child_entity matches Term 0 (has Health)
  → Follow ChildOf relationship from Term 0 to Term 1
    → Get parent_entity from ChildOf component
    ✓ parent_entity matches Term 1 (has Health)
    → All terms satisfied, add [child_entity, parent_entity] to results
  ← Backtrack, no more relationships to try
  Return results: [[child_entity, parent_entity]]
```

## Usage Pattern

### Basic Usage
```rust
// 1. Build the plan
let mut builder = TypedQueryPlanBuilder::new(&mut world);
let child_term = builder.with::<Health>();
let parent_term = builder.with::<Health>();
builder.related_to::<ChildOf>(child_term, parent_term);
let plan = builder.build(child_term);

// 2. Create state
let state = DynamicState::from_plan(plan);

// 3. Execute (would be done automatically in query iteration)
unsafe {
    let results = state.plan.execute(entity, world_cell);
    for match_result in results {
        let child = match_result[0];
        let parent = match_result[1];
    }
}
```

### Integration with QueryState
```rust
// Future integration would look like:
fn my_system(mut query: Query<Dynamic>) {
    for item in query.iter() {
        // item is DynamicItem
        for dynamic_match in item.iter() {
            // dynamic_match is DynamicMatch
            let child_entity = dynamic_match.entity(0);
            let parent_entity = dynamic_match.entity(1);

            // Access components
            unsafe {
                let child_health = dynamic_match.get::<Health>(0);
                let parent_health = dynamic_match.get::<Health>(1);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Next Steps for Full Integration

### 1. QueryState Integration
- Modify `QueryState` to support `Dynamic`
- Add method to construct `QueryState<Dynamic>` from a plan
- Cache the plan in the state

### 2. Iteration Infrastructure
- Ensure `Dynamic` works with query iterators
- Handle archetype caching for the main term
- Optimize iteration to only check main term archetypes

### 3. Access Checking
- Verify `init_nested_access` works correctly with the system scheduler
- Test that parallel queries don't conflict
- Handle access for relationship components themselves

### 4. Mutable Support
- Create `DynamicMut` variant
- Support `FilteredEntityMut` for matched entities
- Ensure proper exclusive access

### 5. Optimization
- Cache relationship traversals
- Add archetype-level filtering for main term
- Implement query planning/join reordering
- Consider compiled query approach

### 6. API Refinement
- Better error messages
- Support for optional terms
- Limit result counts
- Pattern matching helpers

### 7. Advanced Features
- Transmuting Dynamic to typed queries for simple patterns
- Support for `Or` filters across terms
- Recursive relationship queries (transitive closure)
- Aggregate functions across matches

## API Design Philosophy

### The Builder Pattern
Following your plan.md design:
```rust
builder
  .with::<SpaceShip>(0)           // Term 0 with SpaceShip
  .related_to::<Faction>(0, 1)    // Relationship from 0 to 1
  .with::<C>(1)                   // Add C to term 1
  .related_to::<DockedTo>(0, 2)   // Relationship from 0 to 2
  .with::<Planet>(2)              // Term 2 with Planet
```

Currently implemented as:
```rust
let t0 = builder.with::<SpaceShip>();
let t1 = builder.term();
builder.add_read::<C>(t1);
builder.related_to::<Faction>(t0, t1);
let t2 = builder.with::<Planet>();
builder.related_to::<DockedTo>(t0, t2);
```

Could be enhanced to support a more fluent API in the future.

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests
- ✅ QueryPlan execution with simple relationships
- ✅ QueryPlanBuilder API
- ✅ TypedQueryPlanBuilder API
- ✅ Multiple components per term
- ✅ Parent-child relationship traversal

### Integration Tests Needed
- [ ] QueryState with Dynamic
- [ ] System parameter usage
- [ ] Parallel query conflict detection
- [ ] Mutable access patterns
- [ ] Complex multi-hop scenarios

## Performance Characteristics

### Current Implementation
- **Time Complexity**: O(E × R^D) where:
  - E = number of entities matching main term
  - R = average number of related entities per relationship
  - D = depth of relationship graph

- **Space Complexity**: O(T × M) where:
  - T = number of terms
  - M = number of matches

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Archetype Filtering**: Only iterate main term archetypes (like normal queries)
2. **Relationship Caching**: Cache frequently accessed relationships
3. **Join Reordering**: Start with most selective terms
4. **Early Termination**: Stop when enough matches found
5. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple main entities together

## Known Limitations (Prototype)

1. **No QueryState integration**: Plan must be executed manually
2. **No system integration**: Can't use in `Query<Dynamic>` yet
3. **Read-only**: No mutable access to related entities
4. **No result limiting**: Returns all matches (could be expensive)
5. **No relationship component access**: Can't read the relationship itself (only traverse it)
6. **Simplified accessor**: Assumes field offset 0 for relationships
7. **No cyclic relationship detection**: Could infinite loop

## Comparison with Plan.md Goals

| Goal | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Multi-term queries | ✅ | Via QueryPlan |
| Dynamic relationships | ✅ | Via RelationshipAccessor |
| Typed builder API | ✅ | TypedQueryPlanBuilder |
| Component access on any term | ✅ | Via FilteredAccess per term |
| WorldQuery integration | ✅ | Dynamic implements QueryData |
| Transmute support | ⏳ | Structure in place, not implemented |
| Nested QueryState | ⏳ | Future work |

## Code Quality

- **Safety**: Extensive use of unsafe with documented invariants
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive examples and explanations
- **Testing**: Multiple test cases covering core functionality
- **API Design**: Following Bevy conventions and patterns
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a solid foundation for multi-source relationship queries in Bevy ECS. The core execution engine is functional, and the API design supports the use cases outlined in plan.md.

The main work remaining is integration with the existing QueryState infrastructure and performance optimization. The design allows for incremental enhancement without breaking changes.
